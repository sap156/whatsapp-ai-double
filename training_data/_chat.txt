[12/8/23, 9:55:18 AM] Abhinav: 🙏🏻
[12/8/23, 9:55:27 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: Yes scientifically proven
[12/8/23, 9:55:57 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: But on odd day, I’ll marry when I find the right person until then I’ll date til 40 like Americans

[12/8/23, 9:57:54 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: Not for every girl, but usually after 30 aa capabilities koncham tagguthayi anta
[12/8/23, 9:58:30 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: Americans late ga cheskuntaru

[12/8/23, 9:59:03 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: Intlo cheppara? Your intlo?
[12/8/23, 9:59:09 AM] Akshay VSB2: Yeah
[12/8/23, 9:59:20 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: Oh very nice!
[12/8/23, 10:12:57 AM] Akshay VSB2: I think becoming a parent has many layers to it.. social, emotional, financial and of course physical too.. she and I want to find the balance that works best for us. She's definitely not the type who lives life like a checklist. I agree biologically before 30 is good but if one is proactive in planning properly then career and other ambitions can be balanced too. Sometimes I feel these gurus and all just preach patriarchy and make it sound like a very sensible thing
[12/8/23, 10:21:39 AM] Abhinav: We decided we will do it when we can afford a kid. 

But what i think is having a kid takes a lot of responsibility and i  personally dont want to be responsible for another human soul. But that might change in couple of years. At least now im not in that mindset. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/8/23, 10:22:56 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: Yeah I totally agree with you on that. It depends a lot on every individual and ideology. Their generation is different and incomparable 

I believe few things and would want to stick to tradition so I’m easily gullible to those preachings for whatever reasons but on an odd day, it’s just someone else controlling or influencing us and we’re putting ourselves in stupid situations
[12/8/23, 10:24:30 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: Yeah we’re just 28 now. I don’t think we deserve to think of these things in this generation. Everyone is building career and trying to live lives their ways…
[12/8/23, 10:26:36 AM] Akshay VSB2: Yeah 100% agree.. I feel like I grew a lot only after I started dating Pranati and I feel like I need to grow a lot more so that I can be a good parent and a good husband

[12/8/23, 10:28:09 AM] Akshay VSB2: Yeah ra, I'm like that too. I'm deeply religious but maybe because I have been with her for almost 4 years now, I am able to see how it's harder for girls because they impose everything on them in the name of culture and tradition.. I think it's about finding a balance anthe
[12/8/23, 10:33:57 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: Yeah ra it’s a little hard on females. I believe in equality.

[12/8/23, 10:46:35 AM] Akshay VSB2: Kondam... First I'll try to understand crypto
[12/8/23, 10:47:43 AM] Abhinav: Its just MATH ra.. atleast BTC. I hold very small amounts of it compared to ETH and SOL and other coins. But if had to suggest a coin to anyone or advocate for a coin. That will be BTC.
[12/8/23, 10:47:46 AM] Abhinav: Pure math
[12/8/23, 10:48:38 AM] Abhinav: US lo ETF launch itay it will 🚀. Look at what happened to GOLD when Gold ETF launched
[12/8/23, 10:58:07 AM] Akshay VSB2: Hmmm I'll read about it ee weekend.. cheddam
[12/8/23, 11:05:14 AM] Abhinav: Archies lo only odd part is Suhaanas unusual big breast
[12/8/23, 11:05:46 AM] Abhinav: Watermelons
‎[12/8/23, 11:08:19 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: ‎sticker omitted
[12/8/23, 4:38:29 PM] Abhinav: Ohhh Riverdale the series is an adaptation of Archies… i dint know that
[12/9/23, 12:39:19 AM] Abhinay Chitti-bulla: Suggest some good cryptos ra
[12/9/23, 12:39:24 AM] Abhinay Chitti-bulla: At the current price!
[12/9/23, 2:56:29 AM] Abhinav: I’ll wait for a slight pull back. But right know Polkadot is around 7$ its ATH is around 50$ so that still has a pakka 7-8x returns
[12/9/23, 2:58:25 AM] Abhinav: Chainlink is at 16$ now.. ATH 50$. So pakka 2.5x this cycle.
[12/9/23, 2:59:16 AM] Abhinay Chitti-bulla: Okay will look at chart and take these 2
[12/9/23, 2:59:25 AM] Abhinay Chitti-bulla: Okay safe bet kuda cheppu
[12/9/23, 2:59:51 AM] Abhinav: Again simple math ra.. look at the top 20 coins by market cap right now. See how far are they from their previous ATH
[12/9/23, 3:01:09 AM] Abhinav: And do the math. How much returns you can get at current prices vs ATH. Pakka this cycle they will go back to their ATH prices and beyond. Safe aadtha ante sell when they reach their previous ATH prices.
[12/9/23, 3:02:12 AM] Akshay VSB2: How are you sure that they will go back to their previous ATH
[12/9/23, 3:05:43 AM] Abhinav: Crypto also has cycles ra. Everything follows BTC eventually. Around its halving event that happens every 4 years.

First money flows into BTC, then ETH, then rest of the coins, then all the meme and shit coins, the cycle repeats.
[12/9/23, 3:07:41 AM] Abhinav: just like how the stock market doubles in value every 7-8 years.
[12/9/23, 3:07:57 AM] Abhinay Chitti-bulla: Hauu
[12/9/23, 3:08:02 AM] Abhinay Chitti-bulla: Hauuu hauu

[12/9/23, 3:09:36 AM] Abhinay Chitti-bulla: Okay chainlink and polka lo 1L each pedta
[12/9/23, 3:09:41 AM] Abhinay Chitti-bulla: Eth lo 3l pedta
[12/9/23, 3:09:49 AM] Abhinav: It could still go to 250$ its ATH. Now at 75$. This year it already dod 500%
[12/9/23, 3:09:59 AM] Abhinav: SOL
[12/9/23, 3:10:34 AM] Abhinay Chitti-bulla: Light
[12/9/23, 3:10:50 AM] Abhinay Chitti-bulla: Rally aina stocks nenu chudanu
[12/9/23, 3:11:16 AM] Abhinav: See if you can get it around 2100$. If it pulls back. It just breached its 2300$ resistance and has been holding its price above that for over a week. So i dont know of it will get to 2100$
[12/9/23, 3:11:52 AM] Abhinav: Safe bet ill sell at 8000$
[12/9/23, 3:12:48 AM] Abhinav: Again potential ROIs chusko. How much X you can make based on their ATH.
[12/9/23, 3:13:21 AM] Abhinav: This is still speculation.. but the least it can make this cycle is 2.5x ‎<This message was edited>

[5/16/24, 11:40:27 AM] Abhinav: Umpires Nand Kishore and Virender Sharma, holding umbrellas, are involved in a discussion with the ground-staff. Must be to understand how long it will take for them to get play underway after the rain stops. The officials will perhaps then reverse-calculate from 10:56pm to then see if we could have a game. This is my version, could be entirely off the mark.
[5/16/24, 11:41:13 AM] Abhinav: 10:15 ki it should stop raining to start ground work

[11/26/24, 1:20:30 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: Sent chat gpt mail to Hersheys
[11/26/24, 1:20:39 AM] Manoj Kalavathi: Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding Contaminated Chocolate Product

Dear Hershey’s,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my deep disappointment and concern regarding a highly distressing experience with one of your products.

Last month around 15th October, I purchased Hershey’s Kisses from Walmart. Upon opening the package on November 24th, I was horrified to discover live worms inside the chocolate. This was not only deeply unsettling but also completely unacceptable, especially given your brand’s reputation for quality and safety.

The incident has caused me significant distress for several reasons:

The incident has caused me significant distress for several reasons:
	1.	Health Concerns: Consuming a product contaminated in this manner poses a serious risk to health. Even though I discovered the worms before consuming the chocolate, the mere thought of it has made me question the safety of your products.
	2.	Loss of Trust: Your brand has been a trusted household name, and I have been a loyal customer for years. However, this experience has severely shaken my confidence in your quality control processes.
	3.	Financial Loss: I not only lost the value of the product I purchased but also incurred additional expenses in addressing this issue, including travel costs to return the product to the retailer for inspection and potential replacement.
	4.	Emotional Impact: The experience was extremely distressing and has caused discomfort and unease.

To resolve this matter, I request the following:
	1.	A full investigation into the issue to determine how such a severe lapse in quality control occurred.
	2.	Assurance that corrective measures will be taken to prevent such incidents from happening again.
	3.	Appropriate compensation for this incident, considering the distress caused and the financial loss incurred.

I have attached photos of the contaminated product as evidence.

This is a matter of significant importance, and I urge you to respond promptly. I trust that your company values its customers and reputation and will take the necessary steps to address this situation to my satisfaction.

I look forward to your immediate response.

I'm reachable at kagithamanoj@gmail.com and phone: 703-397-3138 and my name is Manoj

Yours sincerely,
Manoj Kumar
